## Features
1. BDD Approach: The framework follows the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach using Cucumber, allowing tests to be written in a human-readable format.
2. Service Testing: The framework is specifically designed for testing services and APIs, enabling the validation of endpoints, request/response payloads, status codes, and more.
3. JUnit Integration: The framework integrates with JUnit. 
4. Rest Assured: Rest Assured library is utilized to interact with services and perform assertions on API responses.
5. Reusable Step Definitions: The framework promotes reusable step definitions, allowing efficient test development and maintenance.
6. Configurable Environment: The framework supports environment configuration, making it easy to switch between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
